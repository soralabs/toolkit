   git commit -m "docs: update installation instructions"
   git commit -m "test(cli): add integration tests for command parsing"
   ```

5. Push your changes:

## Code Guidelines
- Follow Go's idiomatic patterns. Refer to the [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) guide.
- Write clear, concise, and well-documented code.
- Keep functions small and focused.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.

### Folder Structure
- `/cmd`: Main applications for the project.
- `/pkg`: Library code that can be used by external applications.
- `/internal`: Code not intended for external use.
- `/test`: Additional testing utilities.

---

## Testing
- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes.
- Run tests before submitting a pull request:
  ```bash
  go test ./...
  ```
- Use [Go's testing package](https://pkg.go.dev/testing) and ensure your tests cover edge cases.

---

## Style Guide
- Use `gofmt` to format your code:
  ```bash
  gofmt -s -w .
  ```
- Use `golint` to check for stylistic issues:
  ```bash
  golint ./...
  ```
- Follow the [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments).
